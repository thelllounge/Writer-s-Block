            Thanks for checking out the website and using it to work on all of your writing needs!
        </p>
        <p>
            I have always wanted something like this but I've never found something like it, at least not that I liked.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've recently decided to learn how to code so I thought I would make one myself! I'm really happy with how it turned out.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have plans to add more options in the future, more things you can randomize, and maybe even seasonal options! But none of that any time too soon I don't think.
